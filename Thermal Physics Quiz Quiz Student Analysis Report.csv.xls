When heated, particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster, transferring energy to neighbouring particles with no net movement of particles. Two mechanisms of heat transfer by conduction include molecular interaction and free electron diffusion. Molecular interaction refers to the vibration of and collision of atoms and molecules transferring kinetic energy to neighbouring particles and is a slow process. Free electron diffusion refers to the electrons which are lighter and move faster and randomly between bigger particles. It can collide with other electrons and particles to transfer kinetic energy and is a fast process. Metals have many free electrons and thus are generally better conductors of heat. 

Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid (gas or liquid), due to differences in density. It only occurs in fluids as their particles are able to move freely. A convection current is the movement of hot fluid towards a cold fluid and vice versa. When a fluid is heated, it expands, becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser fluid at the top sinks to replace the heated fluid.

To compare the two: Conduction is more of a static process, with no net movement of particles, and represents how thermal energy (heat) travels between objects in direct contact. Convection is more of thermal energy travelling through fluids due to density differences and is generally a faster process than conduction.",0.0,"Firstly, the heat sink is made of metal with metal fins protruding out. Metal is generally a better conductor of heat as they have many free electrons and free electron diffusion, which is a fast process, is able to take place. Thus the heat sink is able to quickly and efficiently conduct thermal energy away from the chip through conduction, as well as maximise conduction of thermal energy to the surrounding air due to the large surface area in contact with the surrounding air. 

Secondly, the heat sink has an open space at the top and larger surface area in contact with air near the base. Thus, air near the base of the heat sink is heated faster, expands, becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser air from the top sinks to replace the hot air, forming convection currents. This efficiently carries heat away from the chip.

Lastly, the heat sink is hot, painted black and has a large surface area in contact with the surrounding air. Thus, it is a good radiator of heat and cools down faster, carrying heat away from the chip quickly.

It is interesting to note that there are different types of heat sinks, including Pin, Straight (similar to the one shown in the diagram) and Flared fins. In general, the more surface area a heat sink has, the better it works, but this is not always true. For example, the concept of pin fins is to squeeze as much surface volume into a given volume as possible. However, studies have proven pin fins to sometimes be less efficient than straight fins. I would guess that the pin fins have less volume for conduction of heat and focus too much on radiation and convection. Thus we can possibly conclude that it is important to consider all methods of heat transfer to maximise effectiveness and efficiency.",0.0,2,0,0.0

Black surfaces are radiate thermal energy much faster than bright surfaces.

The spaces in between the fins allow for more surface area in contact with the cooler air that sinks down to replace the rising warmer air. Due to the higher temperature difference between the warmer fins and the cooler surrounding air, this allows thermal energy to be conducted from the warmer fins to the cooler surrounding air at a faster rate. The larger surface area in contact with the cooler surrounding air also allows for more heat to be conducted faster from the heat sink to the surrounding air.

When conduction takes place, there is no net movement between particles, but there is net movement between particles when convection takes place.",0.0,"The heat sink's black metal fins have a large surface area exposed to the surrounding air, so more heat will be lost to the surrounding air via radiation and conduction, hence it allows thermal energy to be transferred away from the ship. Since the heat sink is a black surface, it radiates heat faster to the surrounding air compared to if it was a shiny surface, so the chip will lose more heat to the surrounding air through radiation. ",0.0,2,0,0.0

Convection is a cycle, where hot, less dense air rises and cooler denser air sinks. This cycle repeats until the average kinetic energy of all the particles become constant. Convection current can be set up with the emittance of radiation from a source.",0.0,"The heat sink has black metal fins which increase the surface area of the heat sink in contact with the surrounding air. Therefore, there is a quicker rate of heat transfer from the heat sink to the surrounding air via conduction and radiation.  The heat sink is also black in colour, which emits radiation at a fast rate, allowing heat to be emitted through radiation from the heat sink to the surrounding air at a faster rate.",0.0,2,0,0.0

As metals have many free electrons, they are a good conductor of heat and can transfer thermal energy from the computer chip into the surroundings more quickly and easily. The heat sink is also black, so it is a good emitter of radiation so as to increase the rate of heat transfer away from the chip and the metal fins increase the surface area to increase the rate of heat transfer from the chip by radiation.",0.0,2,0,0.0

Also, conduction is caused by the particle interaction in a solid/liquid/gas or free electron diffusion in metals, but convection happens when there is a difference in density of two fluids. ",0.0,"Firstly, the heat sink has to be a good conductor of heat, so as to be able to conduct the heat away from the chip in a short amount of time. next, the heat sink is made in the colour black. This is because black is a better emitter of heat due to radiation, allowing the chip to be able to cool down faster. Next, the heat sink has many fins, so as to increase the exposed surface area of the heat sink to the surrounding air, to speed up the rate of heat loss of the computer chip. ",0.0,2,0,0.0
