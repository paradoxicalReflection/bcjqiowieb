Question 2: Explain the features of the heat sink that allow thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.,Score
"The heat sink is made of metal and thus conduction takes places from the computer chip to the heat sink quickly as they are good conductors of heat. After that, as the fins have a large surface area, convection takes place quickly from the metal sink to the fins. Next, as the fins are black, there is more radiation and heat is emitted from the fins quicker. After this the metal sink is cool and thus heat from the computer chip can be transferred to the metal sink to repeat the process and ensure that the computer chip is cool at all times.",2
"It is black to allow for higher rate of radiation.

Metal fins to increase exposed surface area allowing for higher rate of heat transfer via radiation.",1
"Black fins

-Increase surface area which increases conduction with air",1
"the heat sink has a high exposed surface area, allowing heat to be faster conducted away from the chip and then released into atmosphere.",0
"The heatsink has black coloured metal fins. Black and dull surfaces absorb and radiate more heat faster. Thus, since the heatsink has black coloured metal fins, the metal fins would be easily able to absorb more heat from the chip and radiate more heat away from the chip which results in the chip being cool.",1
It‚Äôs metal thus a good conductor of heat and it‚Äôs black thus can radiate heat,0
" Firstly, the colour of the heat sink is black. As such, it absorbs all right lays and heat and as such, gains heat at a quicker rate and possibly even more heat. As such, heat is conducted away from the chip through conduction of heat, resulting in the chip not to be too hot. Therefore, thermal energy is transferred easily away from the chip.

 Other than that, the heat sink is made out of metal. Metals are materials with many free electrons. Thus, they re generally better at conducting heat. When the chip has thermal energy, the particles gain kinetic energy and as such, they vibrate at a quicker pace. Energy is then transferred at a quicker pace, resulting in thermal energy to be conducted away from the chip at a quicker pace.

 Lastly, the heat sink has a large surface to area ratio due to its fins. As such, heat can be transferred from the heat sink to the surrounding air at a quicker pace, resulting in thermal energy to be conducted away from the chip at a quicker pace.",1
"The black color of the metal fins, and the high surface area of the heat sink (due to the extended fins) cause the rate of heat transfer by radiation to be higher. The high surface area of the heat sink also cause more air to be in contact with the heat sink, leading to a higher rate of heat transfer through conduction.",1
"The heat sink is black in color. Black objects tend to radiate heat away faster. Also the heat sink has metal fins which increases the surface area of the heat sink in order to speed up heat conduction.

",1
It has black metal fins which increase the surface area to volume ratio of the heat sink as they are long and thin therefore there will be a faster rate of heat transfer from the heat sink away from the chip.,0
"The heat sink has a flat base and the black metal fins which helps to increase the surface area of its contact with the air. The greater the surface area, the better it is able to dissipate the heat generated. The heat sink has a large surface area, allowing thermal energy to be transferred away from the chip more easily.",0
"The heat sink is black in colour, and black is the best conductor of heat compared to the other colours, so the heat sink would allow the heat to be loss at a faster rate. Furthermore, the heat sink has long black metal fins, thus it has more exposed surface area, thus heat loss would be at a faster rate. Additionally, the heat sink is made of metal, and metal is a good conductor of heat, and thus allow the heat to be lost at a faster rate.",1
"The heat sink is black in colour. This means that the heat sink is a good absorber of thermal energy. The heat sink will absorb the thermal energy from the computer chip faster. The heat loss will cool down the chip. The heat sink also has black metal fins, meaning that it has an increased surface area. Hence, it can emit infrared radiation at a faster rate. The heat that the heat sink absorbed will be emitted to the surroundings faster. Therefore, heat can be transferred away from the chip more easily.",1
the indents in the heat sink allow the heat from the computer chip to transfer to the surrounding air by conduction through particle interaction.,0
"The heat sink has black metal fins which have a large exposed surface that allows the higher rate of heat transfer via radiation. The heat from the metal chip is conducted into the air surrounding it which causes the air to expand, become less dense and rise. The cooler, denser air at the top of the chip sinks into the heat sink which has a opening due to convection. The cooler air helps the metal chip to lose heat at a faster rate which allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",1
"THE HEAT SINK HAS BLACK METAL FINS. BLACK IS A GOOD RADIATOR OF HEAT HENCE WILL RADIATE HEAT AWAY FROM THE CHIP. THE HEAT SINK HAS AN OPEN TOP WHICH ALLOWS HOT AIR TO ESCAPE. WHEN THE AIR AROUND THE CHIP IS HEATED, THE HOT AIR EXPANDS AND RISES, WHILE COOLER AIR IS HEAVIER AND SINKS. THIS CAUSES A CONVECTION CURRENT. THE HOT AIR WHICH IS LIGHTER WILL RISE AND ESCAPE VIA THE OPEN TOP OF THE HEAT SINK, PREVENTING HOT AIR FROM BEING TRAPPED AND HEATING THE CHIP.",1
"Firstly, the heat sink is black in colour, which allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip as black coloured objects are able to absorb heat efficiency. Moreover, the heat sink has metal fins. This increases the surface layer of the heat sink and thus allows it to conduct the heat away to the surrounding quickly, and being made out of metal, it is able to conduct heat well as metal is a good conductor of heat.",0
The heat sink has black metal designs that are designed to absorb and disperseheataway from the high-temperature computer chip to keep it cool. Black absorbs heat to keep the computer chip cool.,0
"Black metal radiate heat best among all types of materials , moreover the jagged shape of the heat sink increases the exposed surface area which would increase the rate of heat loss via radiation.",1
The black metal fins and the sink increase the surface which absorbs and conducts the heat produced by the chip quickly and conducts and radiates it to the surroundings. And the sink allows convection to take place as cooler air from the surrounding rush in while the heated air from the sink rises keeping the chip cool.,1
"The large, protruding metal fins of the heat sink help to increase the exposed surface area of the fins to the cooler atmosphere, allowing the transfer of heat to occur faster.

The black color of the metal fins also help to radiate heat faster, as the color black is a good emitter of heat, allowing more heat to be radiated away.

The large, flat surface of the heat sink at the top also helps in convection as when the heat of the computer chip is conducted away by the heat sink and to the air above the flat surface, the hotter air would rise up, causing the colder and denser air to travel downwards and cool the computer chip.",1
It has greater surface area to allow the speed of heat lose throuh radiation to increase.,1
"The heat sink is black and black is a good emitter and absorber of radiation, so it is able to radiate heat away from the cheap faster via radiation.

The heat sink is made of metal and metal is a good conductor of heat, so it is able to conduct heat away via conduction.

The heat sink also has large holes between the metal fins. Air under the heat sink gained heat from the warm heat sink and expand, decreasing in density and thus rising up to the surrounding air. The cooler surrounding air then sinks due to a higher density, and takes up the space originally occupied by the warm air, thus forming a convection current.",3
The heat ink has more surface area to body ratio with the computer chip and hence more thermal energy can be transferred quickly and easily.,0
"The metal fins are black, and the colour black is a good radiator of heat and will radiate the heat conducted from the computer chip away from the computer chip and into the surrounding air. The heat sink also has a large exposed surface area which lets the heat sink conduct heat from the computer chip easily and lose heat to the air through conduction at a faster rate.",1
"The heat sink is made up of black metal fins. Since black is a dark colour, the fins absorb heat by radiation in the form of electromagnetic waves and the heat is absorbed from the chip by the heat sink.",0
It has black metal fins. Black is a good radiator of heat so it is able to transfer the heat away easily.,1
"Firstly, the Heat Sink is black in colour, which is a good emitter of heat. Hence, thermal energy will be absorbed by the heat sink and will transfer the heat away from the computer chip. Secondly, the heat sink has metal fins which maximises its surface area in contact with the cooling medium surrounding it, hence conducting thermal energy away from the computer chip.",0
"Firstly, metal is a good conductor of heat, so heat is conducted away from the chip easily. The metal fins increases exposed surface area which further increases the rate of conducting heat away. Secondly, black is a good radiator, so it will emit heat away more quickly. Thirdly, there is a lot of space directly on top of the main body of the heat sink. The hot air above the heat sink that gains heat by conduction will expand, become less dense and rise. Cooler air above will take the place of the heated air and a convection current is formed. This ensures that the coolest air is always directly above the heat sink and this conducts heat away from the chip for quickly.",2
"Firstly, the heat sink is black, allowing radiation of the computer chips heat away from it, easily transfer of thermal energy from the computer chip. Secondly, it has a large surface area, allowing more heat to radiate of the computer chip faster, easily transferring thermal energy from the computer chip.",0
"The heat sink is made of metal which is an extremely good conductor of heat because metal has many free moving electrons in it. As such, the heat sink would be able to conduct heat away from the chip more quickly and easily.

The heat sink is black in colour which makes it an extremely good radiator of heat as black, dull surfaces radiate heat much faster than shiny or bright surfaces. As such, the heat sink would be able to quickly and easily absorb heat from the chip and emit the heat to the rest of the computer.

The air at the bottom of the heat sink would gain heat from the chip, become less dense and rise to the top of the heat sink while the cooler air previously at the top of the heat sink would now sink to the bottom of the heat sink and gain heat from the chip, forming a convection current which then allows the chip to lose heat more quickly as its heat is being gained by the air in the heat sink and transferred to the rest of the computer.",2
"It is made of metal, and metal is a good conductor of heat because it has many free electrons, so heat will be absorbed by it easily. It also has a black surface and has a large surface area, which absorb and radiate heat very fast. It also has many holes which hot air which is less dense can rise out from, which spaces will be replaced by colder air. All this shows that the heat sink can allow thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",2
"The heat sink's black fins are good radiators of heat, allowing heat generated by the chip to be radiated by the fins faster. The fins have a large surface area exposed to the air, allowing for faster conduction of heat away from the surface of the fins and hence cooling the chip. Air heated near the surface of the heat sink expans, reduces in density and rises, conducting the hot air away from the chip and allowing cooler, denser air to cool the chip and conduct heat away from the chip.",2
"Firstly, the heat sink is made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat due to the free moving electrons in it. There for heat is transferred away from the chip. Secondly, the heat sink is black, and black surfaces absorb and radiate heat well, therefore heat would be radiated to heat sink. Thirdly, the heat sink lies above the chip, allowing convection to happen.",2
"The black colour of the heat sink will allow for easy heat transfer away from the chipvia radiation. The shape of the fins also increases the surface area of the heat sink exposed to the open air which allows for higher rates of heat loss by convection. Additionally, the metal the heat sink is made of is a good conductor of heat, allowing for quicker rates of heat transfer away from the chip via conduction.",1
"The heat sink has fins made of metal. Metals are good conductors of heat as they contain free electrons which can move faster between particles to transfer kinetic energy, transferring heat easily away from the chip. The fins are black in colour and hence, are better radiators of heat, thus can absorb heat from the chip faster. The gaps between the metal fins allow a convection current to take place. The air near the surface gain heat expands, becomes less dense and rises. The cooler, less dense air above gets displaced and sinks back to the computer chip where it can gain heat again. This constantly transfers heat away from the chip.",2
"The heatsink has long fins of metal pointing away from the processor chip. As the CPU heats up, heat is conducted from the hotter CPU to the top, colder ends of the heatsink's fins.

The heat fins are separated from one another and are flat and long, so as to have the maximum exposed surface area to air and hence and lose heat to the air the quickest.",0
"Because of holes in the heat sink, conduction and convection can take place at the same time through the the air space which is a gas and through the metal chip which is a good conductor of heat. Radiation also takes place and is the fastest way which is boosted by the fact that the heat sink is black, thus causing radiation to take place faster, which transfers the heat away easily.",2
"Firstly, being made out of metal allows the heat sink to transfer thermal energy away faster from the chip as it is a good conductor of heat. Secondly the black colour of the metal fins, allow the metal fins to more effectively absorb heat from the chip when compared to a shiny surface. Lastly, the air in the metal fins get heated after a while. This causes air in the metal fins to become warm and hence, denser than the surrounding air. The cool surrounding air will then enter the metal fins and there is now a circulation of air throughout the heat sink and this ensures that the chip is constaly exposed to cool air which helps the chip to lose heat faster.",2
"The black heat sink emits heat quicker to the surrounding air via radiation, causing the air around it to gain heat and expand, allowing the air to be less dense and rise. The cooler and denser air sinks and this forms a convection current. The cold air that sinks cools the chip and allows heat to be transferred to it easily, allowing the thermal energy from the heat to be transferred away easily.",1
"Firstly, the sink is black in colour. This allows it to transfer heat via radiation faster as black is a good radiator of heat. Secondly, the fins on the heat sink increase the exposed surface area to volume ratio of the sink and this allows it to be in contact with more air. Thus, more heat can be lost via conduction and convection to the surrounding air.",1
"As the computer chip gains heat, it will transfer the heat to the heat sink. As the heat sink gains heat, it will efficiently emit heat to the air surrounding the base of the chip via radiation, causing the air to become warmer, hence causing it to expand and hence becoming less dense, eventually rising up and therefore is unable to conduct it's heat back to the computer chip, due to the convection cycle.",0
"Radiation:

The heat sink is black in colour, making it a good radiator of heat. The heat sink will gain heat via radiation from the hotter computer chip and lose heat via radiation to the cooler surrounding air faster.

Conduction:

The metal fins contain a lot of free electrons which quickens the heat transfer from the hotter computer chip to the cooler surrounding air via conduction.

Convection:

The metal fins have air spaces between them. When the cooler air gains heat from the metal fins, it expands and has a lower density. The hot air rises and cooler air around the hot air, being denser, sinks to replace the space previously occupied by the hot air. Convection currents are set up in each of the air spaces between the metal fins.



With heat loss via conduction, convection and radiation, the computer chip is able to lose heat faster to the cooler surrounding air.",1
"A few features of the heat sink is that it uses good conductor of heat as the material to efficiently transfer heat energy away. Fin size shape, for better circulation of air for more efficient heat transfer by convection current.",0
"The heat sink is coloured black. Black loses heat the fastest among all colours through radiation. Thus, by being coloured black, the heat sink will lose heat quickly through radiation and ensure that the heat sink does not heat up too much.",1
"The heat sink is black in colour, which makes it a emitter of radiation. This allows the heat sink to radiate heat much faster than other coloured materials through radiation. The heat sink also has black metal fins which increase its surface area in contact with the surrounding air. This allows the heat sink to lose heat faster through conduction from the heat sink to the surrounding air. Metal is also a good conductor of heat, which allows it to lose heat faster. Thus, the heat sink is able to transfer thermal energy away from the chip easily.",2
"It has lots of protrusions, which increases the surface area being exposed to the cooler surrounding air, allowing more efficient heat transfer from the chip to the surrounding air.",0
"Firstly, the heat sink has to be a good conductor of heat, so as to be able to conduct the heat away from the chip in a short amount of time. next, the heat sink is made in the colour black. This is because black is a better emitter of heat due to radiation, allowing the chip to be able to cool down faster. Next, the heat sink has many fins, so as to increase the exposed surface area of the heat sink to the surrounding air, to speed up the rate of heat loss of the computer chip.",1
"Firstly, the heat sink has fins which are black, and thus allowing it to absorb heat faster from the computer chip as well as radiate heat away faster. Secondly, the heat sink's fins also increase its surface area and allow it lose heat faster to the surrounding heat through conduction.",1
It is black in colour and radiates heat effectively,0
"Firstly, the heat sink is made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat because it can conduct heat through free electron diffusion on top of the normal collisions between atoms. This means that the heat sink can conduct heat away from the chip faster.

Secondly, the heat sink has fins, which increase the exposed surface area to the surrounding air so that the heat sink can faster conduct the heat into the surroundings.

Thirdly, the heat sink is above the computer chip, meaning that the heat conducted into the surrounding air would rise due to convection and allow for cooler air to replace it, giving it a greater temperature difference and allowing heat to be conducted to the surrounds faster.

Fourthly, the heat sink is black in colour, meaning that it would absorb most of the radiation given out by the computer chip. This prevents the radiation from being reflected back into the computer chip, allowing it to lose heat faster.",2
"The black surface of the heat sink allow heat to radiate away quickly as black surfaces are good radiators of heat. The huge exposed surface area of the metal fins allow heat to be conducted and radiated away quickly as there is huge exposed surface area to emit the radiation at a fast rate and great surface in contact with the surrounding air to conduct heat away to the surrounding air. Finally, the positioning of the computer chip at the bottom of the heat sink allows better convection to aid the transfer of heat away from the chip as the air heated by the heated chip expands and rises and is therefore replaced by cooler and denser air above, forming a convection current and allowing both conduction and radiation to take place at a faster rate.",1
The heat sink is black in colour and hence radiates heat from the computer chip. The elongated extensions also increase the surface area of the sink to lose heat at a faster rate.,0
"The heat sink is black in colour, so it is a better radiator, and can emit heat faster via radiation. The heat sink is also made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat, allowing heat to be conducted away from it quickly.",1
"The heat sink has black fins, which is a good radiator of heat, thus will emit heat faster and allow thermal energy to be transferred away easily. The fins also have a high exposed surface area, so there will be a high rate of heat transfer by radiation. The fins are also metal, which are good conductors of heat as they have many free electrons which can move faster and randomly between bigger particles and can collide with other electrons and particles to transfer kinetic energy. With all these features, the heat sink allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the points.",1
"Firstly, the chip is black. The colour black allows it to emit more radiation, emitting more thermal energy away from the chip.

Secondly, the chip has multiple protrusions, which increase its surface to volume ratio. This increases the volume of air in contact with the hot chip, allowing more heat transfer to take place from the chip to the air through conduction.

Thirdly, the chip has a heat sink. When the air in the heat sink heats up, it becomes less dense, and rises. The cooler air on the top is more sense compared to the hot air, and sinks. This forms convection currents, allowing the chip to keep being exposed to cooler air, allowing conduction to take place.",1
"The heat sink has black metal fins and these help to transfer thermal energy away because firstly, metal is a good conductor of heat with many free moving electrons that will conduct heat away from the device and into its surroundings. Secondly, it is black in colour, which absorbs and radiates heat quickly away from the device. Lastly, the fins have large surface areas exposed the surroundings so there will be a higher rate of heat transfer by radiation.",2
"The heat sink is made out of black metal. This is because black metal is a good emitter of radiation, so the black metal will lose more heat through radiation which allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip. Furthermore, metal is a good conductor of heat, so the metal coin will quickly conduct heat away from the chip. Lastly, there are many elongated structures made out of black metal. This increases the exposed surface area of the black metal, so more heat can be conducted from the computer chip to the surroundings, so it allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",2
"The heat sink is black in colour, and since black radiates heat best, the black heat sink will be able to radiate heat from the chip to the surroundings. There are also black metal fins which increase the surface area of the heat sink exposed to the cooler surroundings, allowing for faster conduction of heat from the hot chip to the surroundings.",1
"the black metal fins increase the surface area to volume ratio of the sink, increasing the amount of heat transferred away from the chip via radiation. The fins are black, which is a colour that is a good radiator of heat, therefore increasing the amount of heat radiated away from the chip.",1
"The heat sink has many fins, increasing the exposed surface area of the heat sink in contact with cooler surrounding air, thus increasing the rate at which heat is lost through conduction, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.

The heat sink is also black in colour, and as it is a darker colour, loses heat to its surroundings through radiation faster, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.

The fins of the heat sink are also spaced apart and are vertical, allowing easy air flow between them. This makes convection very efficient as cooler air can easily sink onto the heat sink and gain heat from it. Thus, thermal energy is transferred easily away from the chip.",2
"As there are black metal fins, which increase surface area of the heat sink, when the heat sink absorbs energy from the chip, it will be able to radiate more heat quickly, allowing the chip to cool down by losing heat faster. Also, as the heat sink is made of black, and black absorbs heat better, the chip would conduct more heat to the heat sink, thus the chip would lose more heat and cool down faster. As hot air rises and cold air sinks due to convection currents, keeping the top of the heat sink open would allow the less dense hot air from the chip to rise, thus transferring heat away from the chip and allowing the denser cooler air to sink and cool down the chip.",2
"The metal fins are jagged, having a greater exposed surface area. It is also black, which is a good radiator of heat. Hence, heat will very quickly radiate away from the heat sink to the air. The decrease in temperature causes the heat from the computer chip to then quickly be transferred away to the heat sink.

Additionally, since the heat sink is made of metal, and metal is a good conductor of heat, heat is even more quickly transferred away from the hot computer chip to the heat sink, thus cooling the computer chip down.",2
"Firstly, the heat sink is made of metal with metal fins protruding out. Metal is generally a better conductor of heat as they have many free electrons and free electron diffusion, which is a fast process, is able to take place. Thus the heat sink is able to quickly and efficiently conduct thermal energy away from the chip through conduction, as well as maximise conduction of thermal energy to the surrounding air due to the large surface area in contact with the surrounding air.

Secondly, the heat sink has an open space at the top and larger surface area in contact with air near the base. Thus, air near the base of the heat sink is heated faster, expands, becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser air from the top sinks to replace the hot air, forming convection currents. This efficiently carries heat away from the chip.

Lastly, the heat sink is hot, painted black and has a large surface area in contact with the surrounding air. Thus, it is a good radiator of heat and cools down faster, carrying heat away from the chip quickly.

It is interesting to note that there are different types of heat sinks, including Pin, Straight (similar to the one shown in the diagram) and Flared fins. In general, the more surface area a heat sink has, the better it works, but this is not always true. For example, the concept of pin fins is to squeeze as much surface volume into a given volume as possible. However, studies have proven pin fins to sometimes be less efficient than straight fins. I would guess that the pin fins have less volume for conduction of heat and focus too much on radiation and convection. Thus we can possibly conclude that it is important to consider all methods of heat transfer to maximise effectiveness and efficiency.",3
"The heat sink is black in color, allowing it to emit heat at a faster rate, thus it cools down the computer chip faster. The heat sink is also uniquely shaped such that there is a larger surface area exposed to its surroundings, so heat can be conducted to the surrounding air quicker. Lastly, the warm air will, through convection, rise up and cold air will sink down to replace the warm air, thus conduction can happen faster, allowing more heat to be lost.

Secondly, the heat sink has many fins and hence a large surface area to allow heat to be easily conducted away from the chip.

"The heat sink is black in colour, and black is a good radiator of heat, meaning it is able to emit or radiate heat at a much faster rate compared to other materials. As such, heat can be radiated quickly away from the chip into the atmosphere.

In addition, the black metal fins each have a large exposed surface area due to the spacings in between each metal fins, meaning that the metal fins have a very large exposed surface area. The larger the surface area, the higher the rate of heat transfer by radiation, hence heat can yet again be radiated away from the computer chip at a fast rate.

Also, the computer chip has a U-shape, as such, the air particles at the bottom of the computer chip would gain heat from the chip, expand, become less dense and rise out of the computer chip from the top. Cooler air at the top of the computer chip sinks into the computer chip to replace the displaced air within the chip. As such, a convection current is set up, and this convection current causes the constant removal of heat from the chip.

With these three features, heat can be transferred easily away from the chip.",2

This allows more heat to be transferred away from the computer chip its surroundings via the heat sink.

The heat sink is also situated above the computer chip, meaning that the computer chip, sits beneath the heat sink. The computer chip acts as the heat source, heating up the air at the bottom of the heat sink, creating convection currents which transfer the heat away from the computer chip.

The heat sink is also black, which is a better radiator of heat compared to lighter colours, allowing heat to be transferred away from the computer chip more easily.",1
"The heat sink is fitted with black metal fins, which are good conductors of heat and also increases the exposed surface area. Thus, heat is transferred faster away through conduction.

The heat sink is also positioned very low, so the hot air above it will become less dense and rise, causing the cooler air to sink, resulting in a convection current. This brings cool air into contact constantly with the heat sink, conducting more heat away.

The heat sink is also black and has high surface area. Since black is a darker colour, it is a better radiator of heat. Thus, more heat is radiated away from the heat sink.",2

Black fins are good radiators of heat as compared to white and shiny counterparts. Individual fins optimise heat loss by increasing ESA,1
"The heat sink has black metal fins as part of its design, which increases the total surface area of the heat sink, allowing the heat sink to come into contact with a greater amount of air, losing heat to it more efficiently. Furthermore, the heat sink is of a dark colour, meaning it radiates heat to surroundings faster than if it were lighter, which allows it to lose heat easily. Lastly, the heat sink has a bowl structure, allowing for a convection current to be formed. When air that has gained heat rises, cooler air can enter the heat sink from the holes in the side to form a convection current, transferring heat away from the chip easily.",2

"Firstly, the heat sink has an increased surfaced area to volume ratio as it is of a jagged shape, having the black metal fins, hence this allows for heat to be transferred to the surroundings away from the chip more effectively through conduction. Secondly, the heat sink is placed above the chip. this then allows more heat to be transferred away from the chip more effectively through convection. This is because, as the heat sink is above the chip, the heated air will rise higher, away from the chip and the heat sink, allowing for more cooler air above to sink lower, allowing more heat to be transferred away from the chip through convection currents. however, if the heat sink were to be below the chip, there would be less convection currents as the air above the heat sink would also be heated from the chip, therefore reducing the efficiency of the heat sink. Finally, as the heat sink has black metal fins, it increases the amount of heat transfer through radiation due to its larger exposed surface area to volume ratio and its black colour, which all increase the rate of heat transfer through radiation.",2

Secondly, the heat sink is composed of several fins. This increases the heating sink's exposed surface area to the surrounding area, this increases the rate of heat loss to the surrounding air via conduction and radiation.

Therefore, these features of the heat sink allow it to lose heat at a faster rate, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily from the chip.",1
"The heat sink is painted black, making it a good emitter of radiation. It also has raised metal fins, increasing the surface area of the heat sink, increasing the rate at which heat is transferred away from it through the emission of radiation. Hence, more radiation is emitted by the heat sink, transferring thermal energy away from the chip easily.",2

The fins of the heat sink also provide a larger surface area for it to emit radiation, thus allowing it to lose heat easily through radiation.",2
"The heat sink is black in colour, which absorb and radiate heat very good. This allows the heat to be easily lost through the radiation of such heat emitted into all directions quickly because of the black colour. The fins allow hot air and the bottom to gain heat from the sink, expand and rise up, thus allowing the sink to lose heat to the air, while denser cooler air above sinks to replace it and then continue to gain heat from the sink, which creates a convection current allowing the sink to repeatedly and quickly lose heat to the air. Finally the fins and sink are made of metal, which have many free electrons. These free electrons are lighter and faster, moving randomly between larger particles and collide with other electrons and particles to transfer thermal energy in the form of kinetic energy. The energy is thus transferred quickly away from the chip into the sink through conduction, and then quickly lost to the atmosphere through convection and conduction, allowing the sink to gain more energy and repeat the cycle.",3

This allows air to heat up more quickly and the cooler air on top will sink down while the hot air rises.",2
"The metal fins are painted black and it emits high amounts of radiation. Thus, due to this, the thermal energy will be transferred away quicker due to radiation. The metal fins also have a lot of surface area in contact with the air so it loses heat faster.",1

The metal is a good conductor of heat and allows for faster conduction due to the free electrons present in metals and the black colour allows for faster radiation of heat away from the metal as black allows for the fastest radiation of heat.

The colder air will then sink to the bottom of the heat sink and thus transfer the heat away from the computer chip via convection. Thus this heat sink allows transfer of thermal energy away from the chip easily.",3
"The heat sink is in contact with the computer chip, allowing for conduction to occur. The large surface area in contact with the computer chip allows for more heat to be transferred from the computer chip to the heat sink in a set amount of time, allowing more heat transfer to take place. The black colour of the heat sink allows it to absorb more heat radiation from the computer chip, to be transferred away from it later.

The black metal fins increase the exposed surface area of the heat sink, allowing for more conduction of energy away from the heat sink. Around the heat sink, the air is heated up and becomes less dense, causing it to rise up. The denser and cooler medium sinks to replace the hot air, and the cycle repeats, forming a convection current.

"Firstly, the heat sink has ridges that increase its surface area in contact with the air, allowing faster heat transfer from the heat sink to the surrounding air via conduction, such that the computer chip will cool down faster. Secondly, the heat sink is shaped such that the air will gain heat from the sink, become less dense and rise, with cooler air sinking to replace the displaced hot air. This sets up a convection current, and allows the heat sink to constantly be surrounded by cooler air, allowing it to lose heat faster. Thirdly, the heat sink is dark-coloured, which allows it to emit radiation at a greater rate, and causes the heat sink to lose heat via radiation faster.",2
"The heat sink has black metal fins that increases its exposed surface area to the surrounding air, so that heat can be conducted from the heat sink to the air quickly.

The heat sink has metal fins that are black in colour. The colour black helps radiate heat from the metal fins to the surroundings very quickly, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",1
"Firstly, the metal fins of the heat sink are dull black in colour. Thus, absorb heat from the computer chip through radiation faster than brighter and shinier metals fins.

Secondly, the fins have gaps in between them through which air can pass through. When the heat sink heats up, the air around the heat sink will gain heat and expand. It will rise out through the gaps allowing cold air to sink in. This sets up a convection current. Through this heat conducted to the heat sink from the computer chip will quickly be conducted away by the convection current.



Lastly, the heat sink is a better conductor of heat than the computer chip so heat will be transferred away from the chip and to the heat sink using conduction faster.",1
"The heat sink is coloured black. The black colour will allow more heat from the chip to be loss due to radiation as black colour gives off more radiation.

"It is black in colour, which means that it has an increased rate of radiation absorption. This allows it to absorb the heat from the chip faster, and its black colour would also cause the heat sink to radiate away heat faster into the surroundings, thus overall allowing heat to be transferred faster away from the computer chip.",0
"It has black metal fins. Black is the colour that radiates heat the fastest from the heat sink to the surroundings. Metal is also a good conductor of heat as it has many free moving electrons to conduct the heat away from the heat sink. The metals fins also have gaps in between each fin, allowing for more exposed surface area to the surroundings to increase the rate of heat transfer from the heat sink to the surroundings.",1
"The heat sink has black fins which are good emitters of radiation so heat is transferred away from the chip at a higher rate by radiation, cooling down the chip.",1
"The heat sink is black in color. As black surfaces radiate heat faster than bright, shiny surfaces, heat will be emitted away from the chip via radiation quickly, allowing it to stay cool.

The heat sink also has fins which help it to increase its surface area. The larger the surface area, the higher the rate of heat transfer by radiation. Hence, the heat sink will be able to emit heat away from the chip via radiation quickly.

The heat sink is also made of metal. As metals are good conductors of electricity, heat can be conducted away from the chip quickly, keeping it cool.

The metal fins also allow for air to move freely in and out of the heat sink. The air near the chip will heat and up and lower in density, causing it to rise. The cooler air above the chip sinks to displace the hotter air. Hence, a convection current is created and allows the chip to continuously lose heat to the air and keep cool.",3
"The heat sink is made of metal and metal is a good conductor of heat so it would conduct the heat away from the computer chip quickly, It also consists of a flat base with an array of comb or fin protrusions which increase the surface area of its contact with the air. the greater the surface area, the faster of rate of conduction, thus transferring thermal energy away from the chip faster.",1
"1) The heat sink is black in color. Since objects that are colored in black are good emitters of thermal radiation, heat that is transferred to the heat sink by the chip will be radiated away by the heat sink quickly. Hence thermal energy can be transferred easily away from the chip.

2Ôºâ The gaps between the metal fins increase the total surface area of the heat sink that is exposed to the surrounding air, hence the heat sink will conduct heat away from the computer chip to the surrounding air faster. Hence thermal energy can be transferred easily away from the chip.

3Ôºâ Since the heat sink is facing upwards, air that is above the heat sink will gain heat from the heat sink, expand and become less dense and rise. Cooler, denser air sinks and comes into contact with the heat sink. This way, a convection current is set up, therefore thermal energy is transferred easily from the chip to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the surrounding air.

These features of the heat sink allow thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the computer chip.",1
"The metal fins are black, so they can absorb heat from the chip easier and emit them via thermal radiation away from the chip faster. The metal fins are also made in such a way that they have a high exposed surface area to volume ratio, so heat can be conducted from the chip to its surroundings quicker. There is also an empty space in the middle of the heat sink, allowing warmer air to rise and cooler air to descend to conduct heat away from the chip.",0
"Firstly, it is black, so it will absorb thermal radiation away from the chip and out through the black fins. Secondly, the fins are made of metal, and are thus good conductors of heat so they will conduct heat away from the chip. The great surface area of the fins also helps to better conduct and radiate heat. Lastly, the heat sink will heat air up above it, causing it to expand, become less dense, and rise up. Cooler air at the top will then be displaced and sink downwards, and conduct heat away from the computer chip, cooling the computer chip.",2
"It is black. Black dull surfaces absorb and radiate heat much faster compared to bright, shiny surfaces so the heat sink can transfer thermal energy away from the chip easily and quickly.

It has fins. Fins increase the surface area of the heat sink, which increases the rate of heat transfer away from the chip by radiation as the larger the surface area, the higher the rate of heat transfer by radiation.",1
"The fins on the heat sink are painted black in color. Black is a good radiator and absorber of heat so it quickly absorbs the heat energy from the computer chip and radiates it to the surroundings. Because it is made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat, the fins are also able to conduct heat away from the warmer computer chip and lose heat to the cooler surroundings at a fast rate due to the increase of surface area exposed to the surroundings by the fins on top of the heat sink. The structure of the fins also help to create convection currents so that the warm air at the bottom of the heat sink gains heat from the chip and expands, becomes less dense compared to the surrounding air and rises to the top and escapes to the surroundings while cooler surrounding air sinks to the bottom of the heat sink and cools the chip.",1
"Firstly, the heat sink has a high amount of surface area in contact with the computer chip, which increases the rate of heat transfer away from the chip as conduction of heat increases with the shared surface area of the two objects.

Secondly, the heat sink is shaped into metal fins. This particular shape of the heat sink increases its exposed surface area to the surroundings. This allows heat conducted by the heat sink to be transferred to the surrounding air much quicker, cooling down the heat sink and making heat transfer from the chip to it faster as the temperature difference between the two will be high.

Lastly, the metal fins are black. Black objects absorb heat better and radiate more heat. This allows more heat in the form of radiation to be absorbed from the chip and emitted to the surroundings, conducting heat away from the chip and to the surroundings.",1
"The spaces in between the metal fins increase the total exposed surface area of the heat sink, allowing heat to be conducted to its cooler surroundings faster. These spaces also give space for the warmer air to rise up and the cooler air to sink towards the heat sink, resulting in even more heat being conducted away from the sink as its surroundings are cooler. The heat sink is coloured black, allowing it to give out the most heat through radiation.",2
"The heat sink is black in colour and has a large surface area exposed to the surrounding air. Therefore, the rate of radiation of heat away from the chip is higher and thermal energy is transferred away more easily.



The depression in the heat sink allows a convection current to be formed when air heated by the computer chip expands, decreases in density and rises, allowing cooler air to flow down. The cooler air then conducts heat away from the computer chip to itself. Hence, thermal energy is transferred away from the chip more easily.



Air surrounding the heat sink helps thermal energy to be transferred away from the computer chip more easily. Heat from the computer chip is conducted to the surrounding air which helps to cool down the computer chip and transfer heat away from it faster.

"First, the heat sink is black in colour. Black surfaces are radiate thermal energy much faster than bright surfaces. As such, the black heat sink is able to radiate thermal energy at a much faster rate compared to bright surfaces, allowing more thermal energy to be transferred from the warmer computer chip to the cooler surrounding air faster. Hence, the computer chip loses more thermal energy more quickly, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.

Second, the heat sink has black metal fins. These fins increase the surface area of the heat sink. The larger the surface area, the higher the rate of thermal energy transfer by radiation. Thus, a higher heat sink surface area increases the rate of thermal energy transfer via radiation, allowing more thermal energy to be transferred from the warmer computer chip towards the cooler surrounding air faster by radiation. More thermal energy is conducted faster from the computer chip to the surrounding air via conduction. The computer chip loses more thermal energy more quickly, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.

Third, the heat sink is made of metal. Metal is a good conductor of thermal energy. Thermal energy is conducted away from the warmer computer chip into the heat sink at a faster rate, transferring more thermal energy faster away from the computer chip. The heat sink then conducts the thermal energy from the computer chip to the cooler surrounding air at a faster rate. This allows the computer chip to lose more thermal energy faster, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.

Fourth, the heat sink fins have spaces in between them and a large surface area in contact with the sinking cooler air. When the heat sink conducts the thermal energy from the computer chip to the surrounding air, it warms up the surrounding air. The warmer air expands, increases in volume and becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser air from the surroundings sinks down to replace the rising warmer air, creating a convection current. The spaces in between the fins allow for more surface area in contact with the cooler air that sinks down to replace the rising warmer air. Due to the higher temperature difference between the warmer fins and the cooler surrounding air, this allows thermal energy to be conducted from the warmer fins to the cooler surrounding air at a faster rate. The larger surface area in contact with the cooler surrounding air also allows for more heat to be conducted faster from the heat sink to the surrounding air. Thermal energy from the warmer computer chip is conducted to the cooler heat sink, then conducted by the heat sink to the cooler surrounding air quickly. This allows for thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",3

"As the heat sink is hotter than its surroundings, it will transfer heat to the particles of the air around it, which will then gain kinetic energy and move around faster. This would result in the distance between the air particles increasing, increasing the volume and decreasing the density of the air. This hotter and less dense air would then rise up to the surface, causing the cooler and denser air to sink down to the heat sink.

"The heat sink is a solid, made out of metal, and has black metal fins. Since, the heat sink is a solid, it would conduct heat away the fastest as the particles are packed the closest. It is made of metal, which means that heat will transferred out from the computer chip the easiest as metals are very good conductors of heat and can conduct heat way extremely efficiently. It also has metal fins which increase the expose surface area of the heat sink which means that more eat can be lost concurrently and it is also black which is very good conductor of heat. This is how the heat sink allows thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip. ",1
"The heat sink has black fins. Black is a good radiator of heat and will radiate heat away from the heat sink, allowing thermal energy to be easily emitted away.",1
"The chip has black metal fins and black surfaces radiate heat very quickly away into the surroundings, thus transferring the thermal energy away easily from the chip. The fins also have a large surface area which increases the rate of heat transfer by radiation, allowing thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",2
"the fins connected to the heat sink are made of metal. as metals have many free delocalised electrons, the fins can transfer kinetic energy to its particles faster, making it a good conductor of heat. thus, heat is conducted faster from the chip to the surroundings. the fins are also coloured black, making it a better emitter of radiation produced by the chip, helping it cool down faster.",2
"The heat sink is black in colour, making it a good radiator of heat, allowing more heat to be transferred away from the chip.

The fins increase the surface contact of air with the computer chip, allowing more convection to take place, and more hot air with a higher density, would rise, being transferred away from the chip.

The metal fins are also a good conductor of heat, allowing more heat to be transferred to the heat sink and away from the computer chip.",3
"The heat sink is made up of black metal fins, which positively influences the rate of radiation. The heat sink is black and dull in colour and surface, which can radiate heat much faster compared to bright and shiny surfaces. Furthermore, it is also made up of numerous protruding metal fins which provide a larger surface area for a higher rate of heat transfer by radiation. Thus, heat can be transferred away at a faster rate from the chip away to the surroundings.",2
"The heat sink is coloured black as heat is lost through radiation at a faster rate when the surface is black. This means that having a black heat sink will allow the chip to lose heat faster through radiation. The heat sink is also made of metal, a good conductor of heat. This causes the heat to be conducted away from the chip faster, allowing it to lose heat faster. Lastly, the heat sink is shaped in a way such that it has a large exposed surface area, causing it to lose heat to the surrounding quicker through conduction.",2
"The heat sink has high surface area in contact with the surrounding air as well as being black, leading it to be able to radiate heat more effectively. The high surface area exposed to the air also lets it heat more air up via conduction, which makes the air gain heat and expand, causing it to rise while forcing cooler air down. This creates a greater temperature differential which allows the chip to cool down faster.",1
"The heat sink is painted black as black is a good emitter of radiation, which enables the chip to cool down at a faster rate. The heat sink is also made of metal, which is generally a better conductor of heat than other materials. This allows heat to be conducted away from the computer chip at a faster rate, keeping it cool. The metal fins also increase the surface area of the sink, increasing the rate of heat transfer from the heat sink to the surroundings",2
"The heat sink has a large surface area that is in contact with the computer chip and thus allows more heat to be conducted away from the computer chip. The heat will dissipate through the black metal fins as there is a large surface area in contact with the cooler air. Additionally, due to it being black in nature, the heat will be lost quicker due to radiation as the fins minimise reflection of the radiation.",3
"The black metal fins are made of a good conductor of heat, thus causing them to conduct heat away from the computer chip and to the surroundings. They are also painted black, a dull colour thus allowing them to absorb heat from the computer chip faster. Thus, the black metal fins allow thermal energy to be transferred easily away from the chip.",2
The heat sink has metal fins that increase its surface area hence there is a higher rate of heat transfer by radiation away from the chip. The heat sink is also black in colour hence the heat is absorbed and transferred at a faster rate away from the chip.,1
"There are three main features of the heat sink that facilitate in heat transfer--it is black in colour, has high exposed surface area and made of metal.



As it is dark in colour, the fins will absorb heat from the computer chip and radiate it away to the surroundings at a very rapid rate. Hence, heat from the computer chip will be transferred to the surrounding air quickly.



Furthermore, as the chip has high exposed surface area in contact with the surroundings, the rate of heat transfer is higher. Thus, the chip will cool down more quickly.



Lastly, the chip is made of metal. Metal has many free electrons and thus are better conductors of heat, so the electrons, being lighter after absorbing heat from the chip, will move faster and randomly between the larger metal particles and collide with other electrons/particles to transfer Kinetic Energy. Therefore, through increased free electron diffusion, heat is transferred away from the chip more easily.",1
"The heat sink is made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat. Thus, the heat is conducted to the metal heat sink from the chip quickly. The heat sink is also black in colour, which allows it to absorb and radiate heat faster. The fins of the heat sink increase the surface area of the heat sink in contact with the environment, allowing it to radiate heat or conduct heat to the surroundings faster.",3
"The fins of the heat sink increase the exposed surface area of the heat sink. This allows the heat sink to lose heat faster to the surrounding air. The black colour of the metal fins allow more heat to be radiated faster from the heat sink compared to a light-coloured metal. Metal is also a good conductor of heat and allows the fins to gain heat faster from the computer chip. The placing of the computer chip at the bottom also allows for more heat loss as the hot air near the chip will rise up to the top of the fins quickly, allowing the chip to lose heat quickly.",2
"Firstly, as the heat sink is directly in contact with the computer chip, thermal energy can easily be conducted away from the chip. Secondly, as the heat sink has a black and dull surface, it is able to absorb and radiate thermal energy faster to the surroundings, transferring heat quickly away from the chip. Lastly, as the heat sink has many long metal fins, it has a large surface area, which increases the rate of heat transfer away from the chip by radiation.",3
Black metal fins are black to radiate heat away from the chip faster as black is a good radiator of heat. Large surface area exposed to the surroundings to lose heat quickly via radiation,2
"The heat sink has black metal fins to help transfer the heat away from the chip faster. The metal has many free flowing electrons, increasing the rate of collision of the particles in the metal, gaining and losing heat at a faster rate, conducting the heat away from the chip faster. The black color of the metal fin absorbs and radiates heat faster compared to bright, shiny surfaces, resulting the heat to be radiated away from chip through the black metal fin.Moreover, the fin structure gives more exposed surface area with the surroundings, increasing the rate heat transfer by radiation.",3
"The heat sink has increased exposed surface area to increase rate of heat radiation. The heat sink is black which increases rate of heat radiation. The heat sink is made of metal, which is a good conductor of heat, and therefore will conduct heat away from the computer chip more quickly.",3
,
"The sink is black, which makes it a good radiator of heat, allowing it to radiate heat away from the chip efficiently. The black metal fins also increase the surface to volume ratio of the sink, facilitating a faster rate of radiation, which allows the chip to lose thermal energy faster and more easily.",2
"The heat sink is made out of metal, which increases the rate of heat transfer via conduction as free electron diffusion occurs, which is when electrons, which are lighter and move faster and more randomly than the bigger particles, collide with other electrons and particles to transfer kinetic energy. As metals have many free electrons, they are a good conductor of heat and can transfer thermal energy from the computer chip into the surroundings more quickly and easily. The heat sink is also black, so it is a good emitter of radiation so as to increase the rate of heat transfer away from the chip and the metal fins increase the surface area to increase the rate of heat transfer from the chip by radiation.",3
