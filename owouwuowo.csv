However, convection is the process whereby a fluid gains heat, expands and reduces in density. It then rises, displacing the cooler and denser fluid at the top and causing a convection current.",0
Conduction does not require a medium while convection does. Conduction can occur in all states of matter while convection only occurs in fluids.,1

"Conduction only occurs between molecule and molecule which heats up other molecules around it and it‚Äôs a stationary process and only happens in solids. Convection occurs in gases and liquids when they heat up, which expands the molecules and their density drops causing the cooler and denser molecules to sink and the hotter and less dense molescules rise, causing a convection current",0
"Conduction is heat transfer that is caused by the kinetic energy of a particle being spread on to its neighbouring particle and so on until the kinetic energy is the same. Conduction can occur in all three stages of matter. Convection is a current caused in fluids only and is beause of the expansion of fluid closer to the heat source, which leads to a lower density and this causes it to rise. The more dense fluid at the top then sinks, which causes the process to repeat.",1
"Conduction is the transfer of heat between two stationary mediums which are in contact, but convection is the transfer of heat between between at least one medium which are in motion.",0
"Conduction requires a medium (solids, liquids and gases) for heat to be transferred while convection can take place only in fluids (liquids and gases).",1
Heat is transferred using conduction in solid and convection for liquids and gases. Convection is the movement of heat by motion where conduction is the transfer of heat energy by direct contact.,0

"The difference for conduction and convection is that conduction in all states of matter, whereas convection occurs in fluids: liquids and gases. Also, conduction is caused by the particle interaction in a solid/liquid/gas or free electron diffusion in metals, but convection happens when there is a difference in density of two fluids.",1
"Conduction is the process by which heat is transferred from one object to the other through a medium. Convection is the cycle in which a substance gains heat, expands, becomes less dense and rises and displaces the substance above it for that substance to gain heat.",0
Conduction is the transfer of heat through the vibration of particles while convection is the movement of air as it gains and loses heat,0
Conduction refers to the movement of heat from a place of higher heat to lower heat through the means of energetic particles colliding while convection refers to a fluid with higher heat rising due to it being of lower density compared to the surrounding fluid and vice versa.,0
"Conduction require no flow of any material matter to transfer heat while convection require the flow of convection current in fluids in order to transfer heat. Conduction occurs in solids, liquids and gases while convection only occurs in liquids and gases.",1

Convection occurs in gases and liquids only, where hot liquids or gases rise while cold liquids or gases sink to occupy the space previously occupied by the hot liquid or gas.",1
"conduction is the transfer of heat without requiring movement of a medium, which can be solid liquid of gas while convection requires movement of a medium which can only be a fluid.",1
"Conduction is the transfer of heat through matter as the particles gain heat and vibrate, and hit other particles, causing them to vibrate and gain heat

Convection is when a hotter fluid rises as it has a lower density, causing the denser cooler fluid to sink, which consequently results in the transfer of heat",1
"Conduction refers to the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without flow of the medium, while convection is also the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another, however using convection currents and requiring the flow of the fluid/medium. Thus, conduction does not require flow while convection requires flow of the medium. Also, conduction can happen in solids, liquids and gases while convection can only happen in fluids (liquids and gases) as only liquid and gas particles can move freely to form currents.",1
"Conduction is heat transfer between objects of direct contact, while convection need not.

Conduction can take place in all 3 states of matter, but convection only takes place in fluids (gases and liquids).

Heat transfer in conduction takes place through molecular collisions, while in convection, it takes place through density differences.",1
"Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without any flow of the material medium and occurs in all states of matter. When heated, particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster, transferring energy to neighbouring particles with no net movement of particles. Two mechanisms of heat transfer by conduction include molecular interaction and free electron diffusion. Molecular interaction refers to the vibration of and collision of atoms and molecules transferring kinetic energy to neighbouring particles and is a slow process. Free electron diffusion refers to the electrons which are lighter and move faster and randomly between bigger particles. It can collide with other electrons and particles to transfer kinetic energy and is a fast process. Metals have many free electrons and thus are generally better conductors of heat.

Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid (gas or liquid), due to differences in density. It only occurs in fluids as their particles are able to move freely. A convection current is the movement of hot fluid towards a cold fluid and vice versa. When a fluid is heated, it expands, becomes less dense and rises. Cooler, denser fluid at the top sinks to replace the heated fluid.

To compare the two: Conduction is more of a static process, with no net movement of particles, and represents how thermal energy (heat) travels between objects in direct contact. Convection is more of thermal energy travelling through fluids due to density differences and is generally a faster process than conduction.",1
"Conduction involves heat transfer through direct contact between two items, while convection involves the rise of hot fluids to the top and sinking of cold fluids to the bottom . Conduction can happen between any states of matter, while convection can only happen in fluids.

"Conduction is transfer of heat by the kinetic energy of particles, namely free-moving electrons and vibrating atoms. Hence, it requires a medium to take place.

Convection is heat transfer by the movement of hot and cold fluids, whereby the hotter fluid rises and is replaced by the cooler fluids sinking. Hence, it requires a fluid to take place, not just any medium.",1
Convection can only occur in gas and liquids as they will rise and sink depending on density unlike solids. Conduction can occur in all three states of matter,1
Conduction is the transfer of heat through particles while convection is the transfer of heat through convection currents.,0
"Conduction refers to the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without any flow of the material medium, and can take place is solids, liquids or gases, or all states of matter. On the other hand, convection refers to the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid, gases or liquids, due to the difference in density.",1
Conduction is over a medium whereas convection is movement of hotter and cooler fluids moving and replacing one another.,
"Conduction is the transfer of heat via the transfer of kinetic energy of particles at the atomic level. However, convection is the transfer of heat via the movement of particles in a fluid, in which the primary method of heat transfer is the movement of particles with heat energy instead of the transfer of heat energy in the form of kinetic energy.",0
"Conduction happens when particles, which have heat energy, which is kinetic energy, come into contact and collide with one another and transfer their kinetic energy from one particle to another, thereby transferring heat energy. It can happen in any substance.

Convection can only happen in fluids and is cyclical. It happens when a fluid is heated at the bottom and the fluid at the bottom gains heat via conduction, expanding and becoming less dense than the fluid at the top, thus rising to the top, allowing it to transfer heat away from the fluid. Simultaneously, the fluid at the top, which is cooler than the fluid at the bottom, is denser and sinks to the bottom, repeating the cycle and transferring heat away from the fluid and heat source.",1
"Conduction is a form of heat transfer where heat energy is transferred by moving molecules or free moving electrons. Conduction can occur in solids, liquids and gases and requires a medium

Convection is also a form of heat transfer, but because of density differences in the fluid, the hotter part is less dense so it rises and the cooler part is denser so it sinks, resulting in a convection current. Convection can only occur in liquids or gases.",1
"Conduction occurs in all states of matter, while convection only occurs in fluids (gases and liquids). A difference in density in a fluid is required for convection to take place, but conduction does not require a difference in density.",1
"Conduction occurs due to interaction of particles, this making it the prevalent form of heat transfer in solids. Convection occurs due to differences in densities, this making it the prevalent form of heat transfer in fluids.",0
"In conduction, heat is transferred away from the computer chip when the heat sink comes into contact with the chip and conducts heat away from it. In convection, the air above the heat sink gains heat and rises, and cooler surrounding air moves downward to occupy the space the heated air formerly occupied, creating a convection current as the process repeats. This current allows the heat sink to continuously lose heat to the surrounding air.",0
"Conduction can occur through any state of matter, but convection only occurs through liquids or gaseous state.",1
"Conduction happens here where the heat from the computer chip is transferred to the cooler metal heat sink, after which the heat will be lost to the cooler surrounding air. Convection will help to speed up the process whereby the metal sink loses heat to the cooler surrounding air as the warmer surrounding air that gained heat from the heat sink rises and cooler surrounding air sinks due to convection currents. Conduction of heat can take place in any medium, in solids, liquids and gases, unlike convection, which can only take place in liquids and gases only.",1
"Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without flow of the material medium, therefore it can occur in all states of matter, while convection is the transfer of thermal energy through convection currents in a fluid due to density differences, therefore it can only occur in liquids and gases due to their particles' ability to move freely.",1
"Conduction isthe process by which heat is directly transmitted from a hotter substance to a cooler substancewhereas convection involves convection currents as the liquids or gases are hotter and expands, causing it to haveand lower density while the cooler liquid or gas has a higher density, hence the hot liquid or gas rises and the cold liquid or gas sinks, causing convection currents to occur. Hence, it is the heat transfer due to the movement of molecules and can only occur in liquids or gases unlike convection that can occur at any state of matter,",1
Conduction does not involve the flow of the material medium but convection does.,0
conduction is heat transfer by direct surface contact. convection is heat transfer by the varying densities of gases and liquids.,0
"Conduction is heat transferred through a medium that does not move, and can take place between solids, liquids or gasses, while convection requires a liquid or gas medium as the medium moves during convection.",1
"Conduction transfers heat through direct molecular collision, while convection transfers heat in liquid when the fluid above the hot surface expands, become less dense and rises.",0
"Conduction is when heat is transferred through the molecules of a solid, liquid or gas, with some molecules first gaining heat energy and spreading it through the rest of the medium, whereas convection occurs only in liquids and gases, where some of the molecules are heated up, gaining heat energy, hence they expand and are now of a lower density than the rest of the medium. Therefore, the molecules of lower densities then rise to the top of the medium, while the cooler molecules then sink to the bottom due to their greater density, causing convection currents.",1
"Conduction can apply to solids, liquids and gases. It is the transfer of heat through physical contact from one medium to another.



Convection, however, only applies to liquids and gases. Convection currents are formed when a gas or liquid gains heat, expands, becomes less dense and rises, leaving spaces for cooler a cooler gas or liquid with a higher density to fill in.",1

Conduction can occur in all states of matter while convection can only occur in fluids in gaseous or liquid state.,1
"Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy or heat from one place to another without any flow of the material medium which can be solid, liquid or gas, while convection on the other hand is the transfer of heat energy by means of convection currents in a liquid or gas only due to differences in density. Convection only happens in liquid or gases because it happens due to differences in density and require free moving particles in order to create a convection current in which there is movement of hot fluid to cold fluid and reverse of cold to hot. However this is unlike conduction which does not involve flow or movement of the matter medium.",1
Conduction is a transfer of heat energy by direct contact without any flow of material medium but convection is a transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid due to difference in density,0
"Conduction can occur in gases, liquids and solids while convection can only occur in liquids and gases. Conduction requires direct contact between the objects for heat transfer while convection is based on the movements of liquids and gases.",1
Conduction requires contact between two surfaces while convection does not need to have the two areas come into contact with each other but have a medium in between them like air or water.,0
"Conduction is applicable to solids, while convection is applicable to fluids.

Conduction involves the vibration of particles to transfer energy across a medium, in which solids, since the particles are closest to one another, are the best conductors (see the root word of this verb) of heat.

Convection, however, is gradual increase in temperature of a fluid due to temperature, and as a result density differences.

Counduction can happen in any medium wheras convection can only happen in liquid or gas mediums.,1
"Conduction is the process where heat is transferred due to a difference in temperature between objects, through the particles from an object transferring kinetic energy to particles of the other object, until the temperature is the same and there is no net transfer of heat between both objects.

On the other hand, convection refers to the form of heat transfer caused due to a difference in density between 2 different liquids, gases or plasmas, causing the heated liquid/gas/plasma to rise as it becomes less dense, while the cooler, denser medium above it replaces it. This cycle repeats, forming a convection current.",1
"Conduction is heat transfer from one stationary substance to another, while convection is heat transferred through a movement in fluids.",0
Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid substance while convection is the transfer of heat through fluids which are liquids and gases.,0
"Conduction is when the thermal energy flow from one point of an object to another point from the hotter region to the cooler region. Convection is when a hot liquid or vapour rises up and the cooler liquid or vapour sinks downwards. Hence, conduction involves the heat energy moving while convection involves the medium moving.",0
Conduction is the water gaining heat from the chip while convection is the movement of the heated up part of the water away from the heat source and allowing the cooler water to sink.,0

Particle Interaction and free electron diffusion are two mechanisms of heat transfer by conduction. Meanwhile, convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a fluid gas or liquid, due to difference in density. Therefore, it only occurs in liquids and gases because their particles are able to move freely. Convection current is the movement of hot fluid towards cold fluid and the reverse of movement from cold fluid towards the hot fluid.",2
"Conduction requires the particles of the heated item to gain heat from the heat source and vibrate more vigourously. When the vibrations become more vigourous, the particles bump into each other more often and end up transfering kinetic energy which converts to heat energy, causing the other particles to have more heat than before.

However, in convection, particles in the immediate surroundings of he heat source gain heat, become less dense, and rise. This displaces particles above to sink down as they are more dense than the heated particles. The particles that sink then gain heat from the heat source, become less dense, and rise. This causes a convection current.",1

Therefore, there is flow of the material medium and it also only occurs in liquids and gases as their particles are able to move freely. These are the differences between conduction and convection.",2
"conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without any flow of the material medium, whereas convection is the transfer of thermal energy via means of convection currents in a fluid due to a difference in density. conduction takes place in all states of matter while convection only occurs in fluid mediums like liquid and gas.",2
"Conduction is when thermal energy is transferred among molecules of the medium and relies on the vibration of molecules for heat to be transferred, while convection is reliant on convection currents due to the different densities of molecules of different temperatures.

Conduction occurs in all mediums, while convection only occurs in liquids and gases.

"Conduction refers to the transfer of thermal energy from the computer chip to the heat sink, without any flow of the material medium, to keep the computer chip cool. When heated, the particles gain kinetic energy and vibrate faster, and thus energy is transferred to the neighboring particles. Whereas in convection, thermal energy is transferred through convection currents in the surrounding air, due to difference in density, as air particles are able to move freely. Air around the heated computer chip is heated, expands, become less dense and rises. Cooler, denser surrounding air on top sinks to replace the heated air. A convection current is set up and the computer chip is cooled down.",1
"Both conduction and convection require a medium to take place. However, convection can only happen in fluids (Liquids and gases) while conduction can happen so long the medium is not a vacuum. Heat is transferred in convection via convection currents, which are formed by the hotter substance rising since it has a lower density and the cooler substance falling. However, for conduction, heat is transferred by the particles of the substance bumping into each other and gaining kinetic energy, causing the substance to heat up.",2
"Conduction is the direct transfer of heat via physical contact while convection is the movement of a fluid gaining heat, expanding and rising while forcing cooler air down, which cools the object down faster due to a greater temperature differential.",0
Conduction happens in all three states of matter whereas convection only happens in fluids. Conduction happens when an object is in direct contact with the heat source whereas convection happenens by the means of a convection current.,1
"Conduction is a process in which heat is transferred through a matter. This occurs when vibrating molecules collide with neighboring molecules, causing them to vibrate too, and as this chain of reaction occurs, thermal energy is transported through the matter.

Convection is a process of heat transfer that only occurs through fluids. When the substance is heated, it gets less dense and rises in the fluid, displacing the cooler substance at the top of the fluid. As such, the denser cooler substance sinks and the process repeats.",0
"Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid medium via molecular collision whereas convection is the transfer of heat through a gaseous or liquid medium due to particles closer to the heat source gaining heat and expanding, thus causing their density to decrease and rise upwards. This creates a convection current around the heat source, thus causing the objects around the particles to gain heat via convection.",0
"Conduction occurs in solids liquids and gases and there is no flow of the material medium. However, convection only occurs in liquids and gases and there is a flow of the material medium.",1
"Conduction is the transfer of heat without any flow of the material medium, and it occurs in all states of matter. Solids are the best conductors, followed by liquids and gases. This is because solid particles are closely packed (based on kinetic theory model), so heat can be transferred more quickly. However, convection is the transfer of heat via convection currents in a fluid (gas/liquid) due to density differences. It only occurs in fluids as fluid particles are able to move freely, but not solid particles (based on kinetic theory model).",2
"Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without any flow of the material medium and can occur in solids, liquids, or gases. Convection is the transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents in a gas or liquid due to a difference in density.",2
"Conduction is heat transfer through or between two solids which involves heat transfer by the molecules or atoms in the solids transferring heat by physical contact of the particles with each other, while convection is heat transfer in liquids and gases by the physical movement of the substance, where the warmer part of the fluid rises to the top and the cooler part moves to the bottom to gain heat.",0
"Conduction occurs when thermal energy is transferred from one place to another through the vibration and collision of atoms and molecules, transferring kinetic energy to neighboring particles and making them vibrate faster. This known as molecular interaction. Thermal energy can also be transferred by conduction through free electron diffusion, in which electrons, being lighter, move faster and randomly between bigger particles, colliding with them to transfer more kinetic energy faster. Hence, conduction is able to occur in solids, liquids and gases.

On the other hand, convection occurs when thermal energy is transferred by means of convection currents in a fluid. A convection current is the rising of hotter, less dense fluids upwards and the sinking of cooler, denser fluid to take its place. Hence, convection only able to occur in liquids in gases.",0
"Conduction happens in solids, liquids and gases while convection only happens in liquids and gases. Conduction involves the particles colliding into each other but convection involves convection currents due to different densities of the medium within different parts of it.",1
"Conduction occurs in all states states of matter, solid, liquid and gas. However, convection only happens in fluids such as liquid and air.",1
Conduction is the transfer of heat by collisions of particles at the microscopic level. Convection is the transfer of heat by movement of fluids.,0

"Conduction is the process of heat transfer when two objects are in direct contact, owing to the difference in net kinetic energy between the particles in the objects. Convection is the process of heat transfer between objects in fluid states of matter (i.e. liquids or gases) where a convection current is formed due to the particles rising/sinking (because of differences in density).",0
"Conduction is the transfer of thermal energy from one place to another without any flow of the material medium by the collision of particles and it occurs in solids, liquids and gases, while convection is the transfer of thermal energy by convection currents due to the difference in density and it only occurs in fluids, which are liquids and gases.",2
